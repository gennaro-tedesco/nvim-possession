nvim-possession





No-nonsense session managerYou are puzzled by neovim sessions and are not using them, are you? Start your
pos-sessions journey, fear no more!

This plugin is a no-nonsense session manager built on top of fzf-lua
<https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua> (required) that makes managing sessions
quick and visually appealing: dynamically browse through your existing
sessions, create new ones, update and delete with a statusline component to
remind you of where you are. See for yourself:


INSTALLATION AND QUICKSTART           *possession-installation-and-quickstart*

Install `nvim-possession` with your favourite plugin manager (`fzf-lua` is
required) and invoke `require("nvim-possession").setup({})`; in order to avoid
conflicts with your own keymaps we do not set any mappings but only expose the
interfaces, which means you would need to define them yourself. The suggested
quickstart configuration is, for instance

- with lazy.nvim <https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim>

>lua
    {
        "gennaro-tedesco/nvim-possession",
        dependencies = {
            "ibhagwan/fzf-lua",
        },
        config = true,
        keys = {
            { "<leader>sl", function() require("nvim-possession").list() end, desc = "📌list sessions", },
            { "<leader>sn", function() require("nvim-possession").new() end, desc = "📌create new session", },
            { "<leader>su", function() require("nvim-possession").update() end, desc = "📌update current session", },
            { "<leader>sd", function() require("nvim-possession").delete() end, desc = "📌delete selected session"},
        },
    }

USAGE AND ADVANCED CONFIGURATION *possession-usage-and-advanced-configuration*

As shown above the main use of the plugin is to show all existing sessions (say
via `<leader>sl`) and load the selected one upon `<CR>`. Once a session is
loaded a global variable is defined containing the session name (to display in
a statusline - see below - or to validate which session is currently active).
New sessions can also be created and updated on the fly, and they will show
when you next invoke the list.

Default configurations can be found in the config
<https://github.com/gennaro-tedesco/nvim-possession/blob/main/lua/nvim-possession/config.lua>
and can be overriden at will by passing them to the `setup({})` function: in
particular the default location folder for sessions is `vim.fn.stdpath("data")
.. "/sessions/",`. You should not need to change any of the default settings,
however if you really want to do so:

>lua
    
    require("nvim-possession").setup({
        sessions = {
            sessions_path = ... -- folder to look for sessions, must be a valid existing path
            sessions_variable = ... -- defines vim.g[sessions_variable] when a session is loaded
            sessions_icon = ...-- string: shows icon both in the prompt and in the statusline
            sessions_prompt = ... -- fzf prompt string
        },
    
        autoload = false, -- whether to autoload sessions in the cwd at startup
        autosave = true, -- whether to autosave loaded sessions before quitting
        autoswitch = {
            enable = false -- whether to enable autoswitch
            exclude_ft = {}, -- list of filetypes to exclude from autoswitch
        }
    
        save_hook = nil -- callback, function to execute before saving a session
                        -- useful to update or cleanup global variables for example
        post_hook = nil -- callback, function to execute after loading a session
                        -- useful to restore file trees, file managers or terminals
                        -- function()
                        --     require('FTerm').open()
                        --     require('nvim-tree').toggle(false, true)
                        -- end
    
        ---@type possession.Hls
        fzf_hls = { -- highlight groups for the sessions and preview windows
            normal = "Normal",
            preview_normal = "Normal",
            border = "Todo",
            preview_border = "Constant",
        },
        ---@type possession.Winopts
        fzf_winopts = {
            -- any valid fzf-lua winopts options, for instance
            width = 0.5,
            preview = {
                vertical = "right:30%"
            }
        }
        sort = require("nvim-possession.sorting").alpha_sort -- callback, sorting function to list sessions
                                                             -- require("nvim-possession.sorting").time_sort
                                                             -- to sort by last updated instead
    })

AUTOMAGIC ~

If you want to automatically load sessions defined for the current working
directory at startup, specify

>lua
    require("nvim-possession").setup({
        autoload = true -- default false
    })
<

This autoloads sessions when starting neovim without file arguments (i. e. `$
nvim`) and in case such sessions explicitly contain a reference to the current
working directory (you must have `vim.go.ssop+=curdir`); this is by design as
this plugin intends to be as less invasive as possible.

Sessions are automatically saved before quitting, should buffers be added or
removed to them. This defaults to `true` (as it is generally expected
behaviour), if you want to opt-out specify

>lua
    require("nvim-possession").setup({
        autosave = false -- default true
    })
<

When switching between sessions it is often desirable to remove pending buffers
belonging to the previous one, so that only buffers with the new session files
are loaded. In order to achieve this behaviour specify

>lua
    require("nvim-possession").setup({
        autoswitch = {
            enable = true, -- default false
        }
    })
<

this option autosaves the previous session and deletes all its buffers before
switching to a new one. If there are some filetypes you want to always keep,
you may indicate them in

>lua
    require("nvim-possession").setup({
        autoswitch = {
            enable = true, -- default false
            exclude_ft = {"...", "..."}, -- list of filetypes to exclude from deletion
        }
    })
<

A note on lazy loading: this plugin is extremely light weight and it generally
loads in no time: practically speaking there should not be any need to lazy
load it on events. If you are however opting in the `autoload = true` feature,
notice that by definition such a feature loads the existing session buffers in
memory at start-up, thereby also triggering all other buffer related events
(especially treesitter); this may result in higher start-up times but is
independent of the plugin (you would get the same loading times by manually
sourcing the session files).


SAVE-HOOK ~

Before saving a session, you can run actions that may update state or perform
cleanup before updating the session.

For example, you may want to only save visible buffers to the session. This
could be useful if loading a lot of buffers leads to slow startup. Or maybe you
want to keep the tabline clean. To do so, you can use:

>lua
    require("nvim-possession").setup({
        save_hook = function()
            -- Get visible buffers
            local visible_buffers = {}
            for _, win in ipairs(vim.api.nvim_list_wins()) do
                visible_buffers[vim.api.nvim_win_get_buf(win)] = true
            end
    
            local buflist = vim.api.nvim_list_bufs()
            for _, bufnr in ipairs(buflist) do
                if visible_buffers[bufnr] == nil then -- Delete buffer if not visible
                    vim.cmd("bd " .. bufnr)
                end
            end
        end
    })
<


POST-HOOK ~

After loading a session you may want to specify additional actions to run that
may not be have been saved in the session content: this is often the case for
restoring file tree or file managers, or open up terminal windows or fuzzy
finders or set specific options. To do so you can use

>lua
    
    require("nvim-possession").setup({
        post_hook = function()
            require("FTerm").open()
            require('nvim-tree').toggle(false, true)
            vim.lsp.buf.format()
        end
    })
<


STATUSLINE                                             *possession-statusline*

You can call `require("nvim-possession").status()` as component in your
statusline, for example with `lualine` you would have

>lua
    
    lualine.setup({
        sections = {
            lualine_a = ...
            lualine_b = ...
            lualine_c = {
                { "filename", path = 1 },
                {
                    require("nvim-possession").status,
                    cond = function()
                        return require("nvim-possession").status() ~= nil
                    end,
                },
            },
        }
    })
<

to display

the component automatically disappears or changes if you delete the current
session or switch to another one.
